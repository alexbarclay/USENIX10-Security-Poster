\item {{\bf The variety and disparities in electronic storage devices:}
A multiplicity of electronic storage devices conceivably implies a multiplicity of data storage formats, each with its own nuances and peculiarities.  Accounting for every existing and emerging format is a daunting task, and one that defies a singular solution.}
\item {{\bf Encrypted data:} The rising use of encryption has troubled law enforcement and intelligence communities for years.  But the emergence and growing popularity of encrypted file systems has propelled this concern to forefront of cyber-law.  One danger is in producing an encrypted data image that cannot be inspected, only to later learn that the receiving party was able to break the encryption and discover privileged information.}
\item {{\bf Deleted but recoverable files in slack or free space on a file system:} Conventional digital redaction tools, which largely focus on electronic documents, do not adopt a file-system centric mode of operation.  Thus, for file systems that harbor hidden data in free or slack space, duplicate data (some possibly containing privileged information) can escape the redaction process.}
\item {{\bf Data fragmentation:} Data fragmentation is a ubiquitous phenomenon among file systems.  Yet naive redaction tools overlook privileged data that spans fragments.  An application-level redaction approach may avoid such issues, but not if the data exists in slack space.}
\item {{\bf Isolation of privilege by context for integrated data:} Privileged information that resides in fully integrated databases can be influenced or revealed by their context (e.g., schema) in the system.  Again, the naive redaction process may overlook an important target for redaction if it lacks an understanding of the system in which the data resides. }

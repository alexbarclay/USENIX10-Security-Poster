The potential for large scale collaboration and data sharing is seriously undermined by concerns over the management and handling of PII in neuroimagery data sets. 
%HIPAA and HITECH rules mandate substantial measures for the preservation of subject privacy, and for the researcher, the management of information privacy is a burdensome task. The potential for sharing and meta analysis of neuroimagery in research goes unfulfilled for two reasons: (1) sanitization is hampered by the lack of tools to systematically expunge PHI from DICOM images, and (2) an established workflow to integrate sanitization into the data sharing process remains conspicuously absent.
We address this problem by augmenting XNAT with a toolset and integrated workflow for pseudonymous redaction of PII in DICOM image files. 
The approach adopted by this effort gives researchers the maximum power and flexibility in sharing neuroimagery datasets while transparently coping with PII considerations in a standardized data curation process.
%\vskip2ex

%To satisfy HIPAA requirements while maintaining ease of use, we offer an automated approach to redacting patient data for use with the eXtensible Neuroimage Archive Toolkit (XNAT) as a repository, folding neatly within existing XNAT operational workflows and processes.

      \begin{block}{Neuroimage Data Stack}
        \rmfamily{
To ensure comprehensive redaction, we have logically deconstructed neuroimage data sets in a layered approach at the hardware, operating system, and data analysis levels.
At the simplest and lowest level on the stack, the raw neuroimage data exists on physical storage media (eg. hard drives) in a binary form as a stream of data.  
At the file system level, the neuroimage is represented as a file pointer to an address space on the physical disk, along with associated metadata.
The DICOM file format is the middle layer, containing both metadata and pixel data in a single file.
The image pixel data can be encapsulated for compression purposes, and the logical layer is the resulting neuroimage.

The primary workflow is based on the XNAT workflow, so that to the researcher, it remains unchanged, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:userworkflow}.
The process begins at acquisition and is stored according to the local institution's policy.
Once it is released from quarantine, the redaction process can be invoked by the user.
This produces a new sanitized data set with pseudonymous identifiers that is sent to the quarantined pre-archive area, mandating a second sanity check before releasing it to the XNAT archive.
Once it enters the XNAT archive, it is treated as normal data and is available for analysis without modifications to XNAT itself.
This new data set contains privacy mapped identifiers available only to a subset of users and can be publicly shared.
%It may be desirable to retain some of the original embedded subject data (such as age, weight, etc) in the redacted data set; in this case, it is up to the end user to verify that the

A logical view of the data is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:logicalworkflow}.
XNAT invokes our external redaction engine, which makes a sanitizes a copy of the data and stores the PII in the privacy map.
The redacted data set is fed back into XNAT.
The privacy map is not made available to the end user but is accessible to administrators through a command-line tool.

      \begin{block}{Architecture}
      \rmfamily{
There are three primary logical components: (1) the redaction engine, (2) the privacy map, and (3) the 	XNAT translator.  
The redaction engine and privacy map integrate into the XNAT pipeline facility, enabling an XNAT-aware redaction process capable of providing feedback, status tracking and debugging features within XNAT.

\vskip2ex

The redaction engine serves as an expandable entry point and contains both DICOM image redaction procedures and a low-level bitwise verification mechanism to fully remove embedded PII. The privacy map is an encrypted database containing the link between the original images and their redacted counterparts, accessible only by an API to ensure the integrity of the databases by exposing a non-harmful subset of commands to the redaction engine. It provides consistency between research subjects of the redacted ID to subject PII, preventing statistical skew due to data duplication. The XNAT translator creates new XNAT identifiers and transmits redacted data in a format recognizable by XNAT.
%
%\vskip2ex
%
%The DICOM redaction component is based on detailed knowledge of the DICOM format and the conformance statements provided by the major MRI vendors.
%A list of name:value pairs are extracted from the DICOM file itself, and these tuples are remapped to anonymized identifiers through the use of DICOM image translation schemas.
%The shipping configuration is tailored to HIPAA compliance, though this is fully customizable.

      \rmfamily{
The privacy map provides a mechanism for linking and managing subjects across institutional boundaries by removing PII and creating pseudonymous identifiers.
This transparently maintains mapped subject identifiers throughout a study and ensures the persistence of the redacted identifier over multiple imaging sessions.
As part of the XNAT processing pipeline, we leverage the existing framework and interface of XNAT, and redaction becomes a natural part of the existing workflow.
The redaction process is forensically verifiable to ensure confidentially of subject data.
This technique is accepted for handling digital evidence, providing researchers legally accepted protection and assurance that shared subject data does not fall under the breach notification requirements of HIPAA/HITECH.
